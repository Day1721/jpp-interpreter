Alpha version of JPP-Interpreter of z-lang

Building:
make

New (updated, removed most of conflicts) grammar can be found in file "grammar.cf".

Current version still don't work well, mostly because Type Checker still lacks 
polymorphism and type interference handling. In next version I'll fix this.
